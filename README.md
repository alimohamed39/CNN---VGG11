# üñºÔ∏è VGG-11 for Grayscale Image Classification  

This project implements a modified **VGG-11 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify **100x100 grayscale images**.  
It was built using **PyTorch** with a custom architecture adapted from the original VGG-11 to handle single-channel (grayscale) input.
